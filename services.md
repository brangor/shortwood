# Writing/Story Consulting
Dagaz’s Writing Lead Fred Greenhalgh has  hundreds of hours of audio writing credits under his belt, including original series (THE DARK TOME, MAYA CRYSTAL, THE CLEANSED) and adaptations (LOCKE & KEY).
Dagaz also maintains a network of writers from various genres across the world with a specialty in audio dramatizations.

We have extensive experience adapting material from other media to the audio format, including breakdowns of scripts, pacing, story structure, etc.

# Studio/Location Recording
Audio drama studio recording

We have built our own world-class facility for single- and multi-voiced talent recording in beautiful Portland, Maine.

We have a stunning selection of local talent thanks to the booming creative scene in Portland (the original Portland), and are also regularly bring in cast from around the world and provide accommodations. Portland is serviced by Boston / Logan Airport(BOS) as well as Portland International Jetport (PWM).

- Studio A [Multivoice] – (4) RØDE NTG-3 shotgun mics
- Studio B and Studio C [Voiceover Booths] – Neumann U-87s.

We also record projects on-location throughout the world. Location recording is more like film than the traditional studio approach. A recordist with a portable sound kit follows the actors through real-world spaces to capture a sense of heightened realism. The result is an experience that feels utterly film-like as actors seem to debate, grapple, and fall in love all around your ears.

Need us to come to you? Of course! We have relationships with casting agencies, studios, and crew in major cities – NYC, LA, Vancouver, Sidney, and London – so we can go wherever the project takes.

# Post-production
We’ve edited, packaged, and shipped several hundred hours of dramatized audio. When hired for a project, we do more than just edit or mix, we aim to create a movie for one’s mind.

A few tools of the trade:

- NLE suite running ProTools 11.3.1, Adobe Audition CC, or Reaper
- Wide selection of plugins (favs include Izotope RX5 Advanced, AudioEase Speakerphone & Altiverb, Waves Platinum
- Over 2TB of sound effects and music for use in design and editing

# Dialogue Editing
We excel at taking raw tracks and turning them into an edit packed with energy. Did you need to record source material in several locations? No problem! Thanks to RX suite, we can match acoustics across recording sessions, and remove extraneous noise (within reason).

We can also ‘worldize’ tracks, meaning, establishing characters into the story world thanks to Altiverb’s industry-standard simulated environments. We build our sessions such that the sound designer (whether us or not) has the ability to pick up the dialogue edit session and is able to seamlessly integrate sound design into the same environments where the actors are placed.

# Sound Design
The sound design teams we work with are masters at their craft, and are regularly used for film, TV, and video games outside their work with Shortwood Creative.

Sound design can be as simple as adding texture and mood to a single-voiced recording. It can also mean painstakingly recording individual sound effects and manipulating real-world objects tocreate a completely immersive story world that feels like a movie.

Thanks to producer Fred Greenhalgh’s travel bug, we also have access to location recordings from across the globe.

# Distribution / Promo Strategy
Have a project that needs a home? Need to understand your monetization options? Leverage our experience and relationships in the podcast and audiobooks space to help find the best distribution and promo partner  for your project.
